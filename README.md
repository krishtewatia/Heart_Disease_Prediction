# Heart Disease Prediction App

A beginner-friendly **Machine Learning project** for predicting heart disease. Built using **Scikit-learn's K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and deployed via **Streamlit**, this app also benchmarks other models to identify the most accurate one. This marks my very first ML project — a complete end-to-end journey from data processing to UI deployment.

##  Motivation
Predicting heart disease early can potentially support healthcare decisions. This project demonstrates how machine learning can contribute to this domain and serves as my introduction to the entire ML workflow—from dataset preprocessing to deployment.

---

##  Features
- **Interactive UI** built with **Streamlit**
- **Primary Model**: KNN classifier via `scikit-learn`
- **Benchmarking** against Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and optionally others
- **Model persistence** using `pickle` for fast deployability
- Fully reproducible — clone the repo, install dependencies, and launch

###  Why This README Works
- It follows recommended structure — clear sections (Motivation, Usage, Results, etc.) per best practices :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- Clear instructions for installation, usage, and reproducibility — essential for data science projects :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- Encourages maintainability and collaboration with a simple Contributing section.
- Includes License and disclaimer — important when dealing with health-related predictions for clarity and ethics, aligning with README best practices :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

Feel free to adjust metrics, dataset links, or code filenames to match your actual project files. Let me know if you'd like beginner-friendly badges, shields, or a rendered preview!
